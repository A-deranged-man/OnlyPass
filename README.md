OnlyPass is a free open-source password manager designed with the intention of being easy to use, and secure. The server is built to run on PHP 7.3 or later with libsodium installed. The application has a REST API to handle login requests, password generation & encryption, password deletion and account registration.

The interface was built to have a minimal visual style that can be easily used on mobile or desktop operating systems.
